**ExoPlayer** is an application level media player for Android. It provides an alternative to Android‚Äôs MediaPlayer API for playing audio and video both locally and over the Internet. ExoPlayer supports features not currently supported by Android‚Äôs MediaPlayer API, including **DASH** and **SmoothStreaming** adaptive playbacks. Unlike the MediaPlayer API, ExoPlayer is easy to customize and extend, and can be updated through Play Store application updates.

ExoPlayer allows developers to create and use custom controllers. In the sample project we will do, we add icons for both full screen mode and screen locking.

## Full Screen Mode üì∫ 

Let's start with how we integrate Full Screen mode, which is one of the indispensable features in the streaming world, into our application. Netflix allows the user to watch directly in landscape mode. Some applications, for example TV+, allow the user to watch in both horizontal and vertical modes.

## Screen Lock Mode üîì

Another popular feature on Netflix recently is screen locking. The user can continue watching by locking the screen. When the screen is locked, it provides the opportunity to have pleasant moments by focusing directly on the relevant content without accessing the player. If the user wants to unlock the screen, he activates all the elements on the player screen by pressing the Lock icon.
